\chapter{Conclusion}

Resulting from the evaluation, using ICN CCN social aware caching for data storage and retrieval has many advantages for network operators as expected, it also provides superior quality experience to end user since the content is closer to these end-users and can be delivered more rapidly. Furthermore, since the social links derived from the Online Social Network have a direct influence on the network delivery efficiency and perfectly fit with ICN CCN features it will in the near future be heavily integrated to us to data internet network architecture. 
This ICN paradigm stand to become a promising solution for various networking applications. In our future work, we seek to better tune our described model as well as adapt an application that utilizes this caching solution as well as make large scale tests on a real network to compare with the current infrastructure. We also plan to explore social links to optimize the routing and delivery of contents over the internet.
